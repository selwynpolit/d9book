# Development
![views](https://api.visitor.plantree.me/visitor-badge/pv?label=views&color=informational&namespace=d9book&key=development.md)

## Overview
This section of the book is about your local development environment and the tools that I find most efficient and effective. 


## Local Drupal site setup

Local development works really well using Docker containers and [DDEV](https://github.com/drud/ddev). Setting up a local site is a completely painless process on any operating system. After installing `Docker` and `DDEV`, follow these steps:

### Install Drupal

```
mkdir my-drupal10-site
cd my-drupal10-site
ddev config --project-type=drupal10 --docroot=web --create-docroot
ddev start
ddev composer create drupal/recommended-project
ddev composer require drush/drush
ddev drush site:install --account-name=admin --account-pass=admin -y
# Display a one-time link (CTRL/CMD + Click) from the command below to login and edit your admin account details.
ddev drush uli
## Or this will open a browser and you can login with username: `admin` and password: `admin`
ddev launch
```

### Install Drupal developer tools

You might want to install the Drupal dev tools using this:
```
composer require drupal/core-dev --dev --update-with-all-dependencies
```

More at [DDEV CMS Quickstart guides](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/) to install [Drupal](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/#drupal), Wordpress, TYPO3, Backdrop, Magento, Laravel etc. 
And the [Local development guide on drupal.org - updated October 2023](https://www.drupal.org/docs/official_docs/en/_local_development_guide.html).

### Install Devel module
To generate dummy content and access a host of other useful tools, install the [Devel module](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel)
```sh
ddev composer require drupal/devel --dev
ddev drush en devel devel_generate -y
```
Read [more about Devel generate](#generating-test-content-with-devel-generate)

### Install Admin Toolbar Module & Module Filter

Every site needs [Admin toolbar module](https://www.drupal.org/project/admin_toolbar) and [Module filter module](https://www.drupal.org/project/module_filter)

```sh
ddev composer require drupal/admin_toolbar drupal/module_filter
ddev drush en admin_toolbar module_filter admin_toolbar_tools -y
```


### Install drushonhost
I also like to immediately install the `drushonhost` addon:

```sh
ddev get rfay/ddev-drushonhost
```
Read [more about global drush and drushonhost](drush#global-drush---run-drush-on-host)


Edit the `web/sites/default/settings.php` so `settings.local.php` loads before `settings.ddev.php` (the order is critical). You will need to uncomment the lines that load the `settings.local.php`:

```php
if (file_exists($app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php')) {
  include $app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php';
}

// Automatically generated include for settings managed by ddev.
$ddev_settings = dirname(__FILE__) . '/settings.ddev.php';
if (getenv('IS_DDEV_PROJECT') == 'true' && is_readable($ddev_settings)) {
  require $ddev_settings;
}
```


### Setup settings.local.php

Copy the `sites/example.settings.local.php` to `sites/default/settings.local.php` with 

```sh
cp web/sites/example.settings.local.php web/sites/default/settings.local.php
```

Add the `IS_DDEV_PROJECT` environment variable as the last line of your `settings.local.php`:

```php
putenv("IS_DDEV_PROJECT=true");
```

After a `ddev drush cr` and perhaps a `ddev reload` you should be able to run drush on the host. e.g. `drush cst`.


### Set config sync directory
Make the config sync dir with:
```sh
mkdir -p config/sync
``` 

And add it to your `sites/default/settings.php`
```php
$settings['config_sync_directory'] = '../config/sync';
```

### Some optional steps
Export your Drupal database with:
```sh
ddev export-db -f dbdump1.sql.gz
```

Export your config with:
```sh
drush cex
```

Add a `.gitignore` file with:

```
/vendor/
/web/core/
/web/modules/contrib/
/web/themes/contrib/
/web/profiles/contrib/
/web/libraries/
/web/sites/development.services.yml
/web/sites/example.settings.local.php
/web/sites/example.sites.php
/web/sites/default/default.services.yml
/web/sites/default/default.settings.php

# Ignore default README files
/web/README.txt
/web/README.md
/web/modules/README.txt
/web/profiles/README.txt
/web/sites/README.txt
/web/themes/README.txt

# Ignore paths that contain user-generated content.
/web/sites/*/files
/web/sites/*/private

# local settings file
/web/sites/*/settings.local.php
```


Create your repo on Github (or Gitlab) and add your site to git with:
```sh
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
# Use your own repo here
git remote add origin git@github.com:hotshotcoderdude/ddev102.git
git push -u origin main
```

Rock n Roll!!!




## Checking Your Permissions

During the wizard installation, or when your welcome page first loads, you might see a warning about the permissions settings on your `/sites/web/default` directory and one file inside that directory: `settings.php`.

After the installation script runs, [Drupal will try to set the web/sites/default directory permissions to read and execute for all groups](https://www.drupal.org/docs/7/install/step-3-create-settingsphp-and-the-files-directory): this is a 555 permissions setting. It will also attempt to set permissions for default/settings.php to read-only, or 444. If you encounter this warning, run these two chmod commands from your project's root directory. Failure to do so poses a security risk:

```
chmod 555 web/sites/default
```

```
chmod 444 web/sites/default/settings.php
```

To verify that you have the correct permissions, run this `ls` command with the a, l, h, and d switches and check that your permissions match the following output:

```
$ ls -alhd web/sites/default web/sites/default/settings.php

dr-xr-xr-x 8 sammy staff 256 Jul 21 12:56 web/sites/default
-r--r--r-- 1 sammy staff 249 Jul 21 12:12 web/sites/default/settings.php
```

You are now ready to develop a Drupal website on your local machine.

## Converting existing site (non-composer based) to use composer

here are some resources if you find yourself in this unfortunate situation:
Taking an existing Drupal application that is not managed with Composer and beginning to manage it with Composer can be a little tricky. Check out this tutorial on how to [use Composer with Your Drupal Project from Drupalize.me - Updated August 2023](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/use-composer-your-drupal-project?p=3233).
Also this [Composerize Drupal github repo - June 2022](https://github.com/grasmash/composerize-drupal) may be useful.





## DDEV

For local Docker container development on any platform, there is no better tool than DDEV. This is a [well-documented](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [well-supported](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#support-and-user-contributed-documentation) tool by the Amazing Randy Fay. You can get help from him or some of the other friendly folks on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hCZFfAMc5k) almost instantly.

From the docs:

-   Lots of built-in help: ddev help and ddev help \<command\>. You\'ll find examples and explanations.

-   [DDEV Documentation](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/faq/)

-   [DDEV Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ddev) for support and frequently asked questions. We respond quite quickly here and the results provide quite a library of user-curated solutions.

-   [DDEV issue queue](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues) for bugs and feature requests

-   Interactive community support on [Discord](https://discord.gg/hCZFfAMc5k) for everybody, plus sub-channels for CMS-specific questions and answers.

-   [ddev-contrib](https://github.com/drud/ddev-contrib) repo provides a number of vetted user-contributed recipes for extending and using DDEV. Your contributions are welcome.

-   [awesome-ddev](https://github.com/drud/awesome-ddev) repo has loads of external resources, blog posts, recipes, screencasts, and the like. Your contributions are welcome.

-   [Twitter with tag #ddev](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ddev&src=typd&f=live) will get to us, but it\'s not as good for interactive support, but we\'ll answer anywhere.

### Local config -  your .ddev/config.local.yaml

From https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/config_yaml

-  You can override the config.yaml with extra files named `config.*.yaml\`. For example, use `.ddev/config.local.yaml` for configuration that is specific to one environment, and that is not intended to be checked into the team's default config.yaml.

- Additionally, you could add a `.ddev/config.selwyn.yaml` for Selwyn-specific values. I like to set the timezone and the router port in case some of my coworkers use an alternate port:

```yaml
router_http_port: "80"
router_https_port: "443"
timezone: America/Chicago
```

- Use ddev start (or ddev restart) after making changes to get the changes to take effect.

- In the endless quest for speed in local development, DDEV uses Mutagen on MAC OS. Apparently the WSL2 setup on Windows 10/11 is the fastest performer for DDEV at the time of this writing.


### Fish shell in DDEV containers

This is a real productivity enhancement.  When you use `ddev ssh` you get the old boring bash shell.  For a cooler more whizbang [fish](https://fishshell.com/) shell, which will delight you with features like tab completions and syntax highlighting that just work, with nothing new to learn or configure, use the following:

In your `.ddev/config.yaml` add the following line:

```yaml
webimage_extra_packages: [fish]
```

In your `.ddev/homeadditions/.profile` add this:

```bash
# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi
fish
```

Now ddev ssh will load fish automagically

```
ddev ssh
Welcome to fish, the friendly interactive shell
Type `help` for instructions on how to use fish
spolit@ddev101-web /v/w/html (main)>
```

If you don't see fish loading, you can confirm that the `.profile` file successfully made it to the containers by ssh'ing into the container and cat'ing and file'ing the file. `file` should return `ASCII text` and cat should display clear text with no strange codes.  See below for details. If you don't see clear text, try using a different editor to recreate the file:

```bash
ddev ssh
spolit@tea-web:/var/www/html$ cat ~/.profile
# ~/.profile: executed by the command interpreter for login shells.
# This file is not read by bash(1), if ~/.bash_profile or ~/.bash_login
# exists.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files for examples.
# the files are located in the bash-doc package.

# the default umask is set in /etc/profile; for setting the umask
# for ssh logins, install and configure the libpam-umask package.
#umask 022

# if running bash
if [ -n "$BASH_VERSION" ]; then
    # include .bashrc if it exists
    if [ -f "$HOME/.bashrc" ]; then
	. "$HOME/.bashrc"
    fi
fi

# set PATH so it includes user's private bin if it exists
if [ -d "$HOME/bin" ] ; then
    PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
fi


spolit@tea-web:/var/www/html$ file ~/.profile
/home/spolit/.profile: ASCII text
```

::: tip Note
You can also create a global .profile file to run in all containers at ~/.ddev/homeadditions.  This doesn't apply to loading fish in all containers as there is not currently a facility to handle global `webimage_extra_packages`.
:::

### setup aliases in ddev

I love short linux aliases like `ll` (or just `l`) for listing files. If you spend time poking around the file system in your containers this makes life so much better. A cool new feature since Ddev v15.1 lets you add aliases using this technique

Use ddev ssh to "ssh" into the container and then type ll to list the files in a directory.

Either copy `.ddev/homeadditions/bash_aliases.example` to `.ddev/homeadditions/bash_aliases` and add them there!

OR

Create a file `.ddev/homeadditions/.bash_aliases` with these contents: note. those are the letter `L` lower case (as in lima).

```
alias ll="ls -lhAp"
alias l="ls -lhAp"
```

Note. don't use `.homeadditions` - use the `homeadditions` with no period (or full stop) in front.

### Upgrading DDEV

After you install a new version of ddev, run `ddev stop` and then `ddev config` to reconfigure things for your project. Just press enter for all the questions. It keeps things rolling smoothly. Run `ddev start` to start it all back up again. 
```sh
brew upgrade ddev
```


### Show others your ddev local site using ngrok

Check out [sharing your DDEV-Local site via a public URL using `ddev share` and ngrok by Mike Anello updated Mar 2020](https://www.drupaleasy.com/blogs/ultimike/2019/06/sharing-your-ddev-local-site-public-url-using-ddev-share-and-ngrok)


### Email Capture and Review

Mailpit (which replaced MailHog) is a mail catcher which is configured to capture and display emails sent in the development environment.

After your project is started, access the Mailpit web interface at `http://mysite.ddev.site:8026` or use `ddev launch -m` to launch Mailpit.


Mailpit will not intercept emails if your application is configured to use SMTP or a third-party ESP integration.

If you’re using SMTP for outgoing mail—with Symfony Mailer or SMTP modules, for example—update your application’s SMTP server configuration to use localhost and Mailpit’s port 1025.


[Read more in the DDEV docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/usage/developer-tools/#email-capture-and-review-mailpit)



### DDEV and Xdebug

This is a magical match made in heaven. To enable or disable Xdebug use

`$ ddev xdebug on`

and 

`$ ddev xdebug off`

Note. This will slow everything down because xdebug has a significant performance impact so be sure to disable it when you are finished with your debugging session.

In phpstorm, you can uncheck the following settings:

- force break at first line when no path mapping is specified
- force break at first line when a script is outside the project

Note. we usually use port 9000 for xdebug look in `.ddev/php/xdebug_report_port.ini` for the real port settings. Recently for a project I found it  set to 11011

The contents of the file are:

```
[PHP]

xdebug.remote_port=11011
```

For phpstorm, if you start listening for a debug connection, it should automatically try to create a debug server config for you. If it doesn't manually create one using the following values:

e.g 
- name: tea.ddev.site
- host tea.ddev.site
- port: 80
- debugger: xdebug
- check use path mappings
- for docroot specify: /var/www/html/docroot (i.e. wherever index.php is)


### Command line or drush debugging

For command line or drush debugging (xdebug, phpstorm)

```
ddev ssh
```

```
export PHP_IDE_CONFIG=\"serverName=d8git.ddev.site\"
```

or

```
export PHP_IDE_CONFIG=\"serverName=inside-mathematics.ddev.site\"
```

confirm debug is turned on

```
php -i | grep debug
```

You should see: 

```
xdebug support => enabled
```

Also you can confirm the port

set a server in phpstorm that matches the name `d8git.ddev.site` or `inside-mathematics.ddev.site`.

Configure the server to use path mappings

`/Users/selwyn/Sites/ddev 82 ---> /var/www/html`

click listen for debug connections button

set breakpoint and run

replace `d8git.ddev.site` with the name of your project

::: tip Note
You must execute drush from the vendor dir or you will always be ignored like this:
```
../vendor/drush/drush/drush fixmat
```
:::

If it doesn't seem to work, try enable Break at first line in PHP scripts - it will usually stop there.


Read [more at stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50283253/how-can-i-step-debug-a-drush-command-with-ddev-and-phpstorm)


### Use drush commands in your shell with DDEV

If you do local development, you can use syntax like `ddev drush cst` to execute `drush` commands in the container. This is slower than running on your native system because they are executed in the container but I prefer using `drush` directly on the host computer as I get to the benefits of [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

To do this install PHP as well [drush globally](setup_mac#global-drush). Then following the steps to [install drushonhost](drush#global-drush-run-drush-on-host). Once these are working, you can `cd` into the project directory and issue commands like `drush cr`,  `drush cst` or `drush cim -y` etc. It is *so* very quick and smooth.  (Note. this is the case with MacOS and Linux and I suspect it should work fine on WSL2 on Windows.)




### Download a Drupal database and load it locally

You can download a Drupal database using `drush sql-dump` and then import it into the local site with the sequence of commands listed below. Using [drush aliases](https://www.drush.org/latest/site-aliases/) with a site called `abc` where you want to import the `prod` (production) database:

```
drush @abc.prod sql-dump >dbprod.sql
gzip dbprod.sql
ddev import-db --src=dbprod.sql.gz
```
This works with any site where you've set up your [drush aliases](https://www.drush.org/latest/site-aliases/) including Acquia.

::: tip Note
If you see the following error: `mysqldump: Error: 'Access denied; you need (at least one of) the PROCESS privilege(s) for this operation' when trying to dump tablespaces` 
you can rather use:

`drush @abc.prod sql-dump --extra-dump=--no-tablespaces > dbprod.sql`

[more at](https://support.acquia.com/hc/en-us/articles/1500002909602-Drush-throws-an-Access-denied-you-need-at-least-one-of-the-PROCESS-privilege-s-error-message)
:::



### Cleanup some disk space 

Free up disk space used by previous docker image versions. This does no harm.

```sh
ddev delete images
```

also

```sh
docker system prune
```

and

```sh
docker image prune -a
```

List all docker volumes

```
docker volume ls
```

Read more about [DDEV General cleanup](https://github.com/drud/ddev/issues/1465)

### Accessing specific containers

To ssh into a specific service e.g. from a
docker-composer.chromedriver.yml the service is listed under "services:"
like:

```
services:
  chromedriver
```

Use

`ddev ssh -s chromedriver`

or for selenium, use:

`ddev ssh -s selenium`


## DDEV Troubleshooting

### Why is DDEV doing strange things?

You can find out what it’s doing, use `DDEV_DEBUG=true ddev start` or even `DDEV_VERBOSE=true ddev start`. This will display all sorts of debug or verbose information which might give you more information on problems.


### Running out of docker disk space

if ddev won't start and shows:

```
Creating ddev-router ... done
Failed to start ddev82: db container failed: log=, err=container exited, please use 'ddev logs -s db` to find out why it failed
```

Looking in the log, you might see:

```
preallocating 12582912 bytes for file ./ibtmp1 failed with error 28
2020-03-16 14:27:54 140144158233920 [ERROR] InnoDB: Could not set the file size of './ibtmp1'. Probably out of disk space
```

That is the clue.

You can kill off images using

```
ddev delete images
```

or the more drastic

```
docker rmi -f $(docker images -q)
```

Q. Deleting the images: Does that mean it will delete the db snapshots?
A. No, docker images are the versioned images that come from dockerhub, they\'re are always replaceable. Absolutely nothing you do with ddev will delete your snapshots - you have to remove them manually. They\'re stored in .ddev/db_snapshots on the host (under each project)

also

```sh
docker system prune
```

and this command prunes every single thing, destroys all ddev databases and your composer cache.

```sh
docker system prune --volumes
```


### DDEV won't start

ddev pull or ddev start failed with error something like:

```
Pull failed: db container failed: log=, err=health check timed out: labels map[com.ddev.site-name:inside-mathematics com.docker.compose.service:db] timed out without becoming healthy, status=
```

Or like this:

```
$ ddev start
Starting inside-mathematics... 
Pushing mkcert rootca certs to ddev-global-cache 
Pushed mkcert rootca certs to ddev-global-cache 
Creating ddev-inside-mathematics-db ... done
Creating ddev-inside-mathematics-dba ... done
Creating ddev-inside-mathematics-web ... done
 
Creating ddev-router ... done
 
Failed to start inside-mathematics: db container failed: log=, err=health check timed out: labels map[com.ddev.site-name:inside-mathematics com.docker.compose.service:db] timed out without becoming healthy, status=
```

This is almost always caused by a corrupted database, most often in a larger database. Since v0.17.0, this is generally only caused by docker being shut down in an ungraceful way. Unfortunately, both Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac shut down without notifying the container during upgrade, with a manual Docker exit, or at system shutdown. It can be avoided by stopping or removing your projects before letting Docker
exit.

To fix, `ddev remove --remove-data`, then `ddev start`. This may fail and suggest this bazooka version:

```sh
ddev stop --remove-data --omit-snapshot
```

### PHPStorm and Xdebug

Debugging drush commands at <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/drupal-support.html#debugging-drush-commands>

PHPStorm has a series of instructions for [configuring PHPStorm with Xdebug](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/phpstorm/configuring-xdebug.html#configure-xdebug-wsl) but unfortunately, nothing specifically on using it with DDEV. Fortunately it doesn't require any special setup for it to work.

Some settings I use

![PhpStorm settings](/images/image1-phpstorm.png)

And for this project

![PhpStorm settings](/images/image2-phpstorm.png)

If phpstorm doesn't stop when you set a breakpoint on some code, try deleting the server from the config debug, php, servers.

Make sure PHPStorm is listening by clicking the listen button

![PhpStorm settings](/images/image3-phpstorm.png)

When you try again it will be recreated but you will probably need to specify the path (from the image above).


#### add a breakpoint in code

You can click on the line number or add the following in code: 

```php
xdebug_break()
```

### Collecting PhpStorm debugging logs

-   In the Settings/Preferences dialog (⌘ ,) , go to PHP.

-   From the PHP executable list, choose the relevant PHP interpreter and click  next to it. In the CLI Interpreters dialog that opens, click the Open in Editor link next to the Configuration file: \<path to php.ini\> file. Close all the dialogs and switch to the tab where the php.ini file is opened.

-   In the php.ini, enable Xdebug logging by adding the following line:

-   For Xdebug 3xdebug.log=\"path_to_log/xdebug.log\"The log file contains the raw communication between PhpStorm and Xdebug as well as any warnings or errors:

### Code Sniffing

You can set up PhpStorm to automatically look at your code and warn you of lines that do not meet [Drupal Coding Standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards). This does require that you have installed the [coder module](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder). See [How to implement Drupal Coding standards at drupalize.me](https://drupalize.me/tutorial/how-implement-drupal-code-standards) for details on how to install and configure it.

Go to: Settings, Php, Debug, Quality Tools, PHP_CodeSniffer

Use the following settings:
- Configuration: System PHP
- Coding standard: Drupal

Under the `...` button set the PHP_CodeSniffer path to : `/Users/spolit/.composer/vendor/bin/phpcs`
If you have installed phpcs globally, this is the correct path to use. If you have installed PHP_CodeSniffer in your project locally, you could use a path like: `/Users/spolit/Sites/tea/vendor/bin/phpcs` and it will work fine.

::: tip Note
(replace `/Users/spolit` with your own path to your username)

## PHPStan static code analysis

### Installing PHPStan

```sh
composer require  --dev phpstan/phpstan phpstan/extension-installer mglaman/phpstan-drupal phpstan/phpstan-deprecation-rules
```

Create a `phpstan.neon` in the root of the project.  This one includes the `editorUrl` so you can click on links in the terminal to open PHPStorm at your line of code.  It also includes a line to exclude the `Unsafe usage message` that is common in Drupal code.  See Phil Norton\'s article [Running PHPStan On Drupal Custom Modules - July 2022](https://www.hashbangcode.com/article/drupal-9-running-phpstan-drupal-custom-modules) for more.
```
parameters:
    level: 0
    paths:
        - web/modules/custom
    editorUrl: 'phpstorm://open?file=%%file%%&line=%%line%%'
    ignoreErrors:
        - '#Unsafe usage of new static\(\)#'

```
PHPStan has a number of levels that dictate what sort of things it will look for. Level 0, being the lowest level, looks for some basic checks like variables not being assigned and unknown classes being used. You can find the [full description of the different levels on the PHPStan website](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/rule-levels).

>0 - basic checks, unknown classes, unknown functions, unknown methods called on $this, wrong number of arguments passed to those methods and functions, always undefined variables
>1 - possibly undefined variables, unknown magic methods and properties on classes with __call and __get
>2 - unknown methods checked on all expressions (not just $this), validating PHPDocs
>3 - return types, types assigned to properties
>4 - basic dead code checking - always false instanceof and other type checks, dead else branches, unreachable code after return; etc.
>5 - checking types of arguments passed to methods and functions
>6 - report missing typehints
>7 - report partially wrong union types - if you call a method that only exists on some types in a union type, level 7 starts to report that; other possibly incorrect situations
>8 - report calling methods and accessing properties on nullable types
>9 - be strict about the mixed type - the only allowed operation you can do with it is to pass it to another mixed


### Running PHPStan

`vendor/bin/phpstan analyze` will run against any files in the paths specified in the `phpstan.neon` file.

You can override those with command line options like: `vendor/bin/phpstan analyze --level 2 web/modules/custom/general/src/controller`

You can also run it against a specific file like: `vendor/bin/phpstan analyze --level 6 web/modules/custom/general/src/controller/GeneralController.php`


Here is a sample of the output:

```
vendor/bin/phpstan analyze --level 6 web/modules/custom/general/src/controller/GeneralController.php
Note: Using configuration file /Users/selwyn/Sites/d9book2/phpstan.neon.

If you run out of memory, try using a higher memory limit as [documented at phpstan.org](https://phpstan.org/user-guide/command-line-usage#--memory-limit):

`vendor/bin/phpstan.phar --memory-limit=256M` or even `vendor/bin/phpstan --memory-limit=1G`

## VS Code and Drupal

Some folks like to use [Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a free alternative to PHPStorm. 



It has a number of plugins that can make it a powerful tool for Drupal development. Here are some of the plugins that you might find useful:

- [PHP Intelephense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bmewburn.vscode-intelephense-client) - a high performance PHP language server packed full of features.
- [PHP Debug](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=felixfbecker.php-debug) - a VS Code extension to enable debugging of PHP scripts.
- [PHP CS Fixer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=junstyle.php-cs-fixer) - a PHP coding standards fixer for Visual Studio Code.
- [PHP DocBlocker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=neilbrayfield.php-docblocker) - a simple, dependency free PHP specific DocBlocking package.

Mike Anello of [Drupaleasy](https://www.drupaleasy.com/) has a Youtube video from Midcamp explaining how to set up [VS Code for Drupal Development - March 2024](https://youtu.be/p-nz369Savs?si=-7cc5IW96LlEw5e9). The session description is:

>Attendees of this session will leave with the knowledge necessary to configure their copy of Visual Studio Code as will be demonstrated in the session. 
>
>Learning objectives
>
>Integrate phpcs, phpcbf, and PhpStan with Visual Studio Code
>Integrate Xdebug with Visual Studio Code
>Install and configure recommended Visual Studio Code extensions for Drupal development




## Troubleshooting Xdebug with DDEV

- Use curl or a browser to create a web request. For example, curl https://d9.ddev.site
- If the IDE doesn\'t respond, take a look at ddev logs (`ddev logs`). If you see a message like \"\"PHP message: Xdebug: \[Step Debug\] Could not connect to debugging client. Tried: host.docker.internal:9000 (through xdebug.client_host/xdebug.client_port)\" then php/xdebug (inside the container) is not able to make a connection to port 9000.
- In PhpStorm, disable the \"listen for connections\" button so it won't listen. Or just exit PhpStorm. 
- `ddev ssh` into the web container. Can you run telnet host.docker.internal 9000 and have it connect? If not, follow the instructions above about disabling firewall and adding an exception for port 9000.
- In PhpStorm, disable the “listen for connections” button so it won’t listen. Or exit PhpStorm. With another IDE like VS Code, stop the debugger from listening.
- `ddev ssh` into the web container. Can you run `telnet host.docker.internal 9000` and have it connect? If so, you have something else running on port 9000. On the host, use `sudo lsof -i :9000 -sTCP:LISTEN` to find out what’s there and stop it. Don’t continue debugging until your telnet command does not connect. (On Windows WSL2 you may have to look for listeners both inside WSL2 and on the Windows side.)
- Now click the “listen” button on PhpStorm to start listening for connections.
- `ddev ssh` and try the `telnet host.docker.internal 9000` again. It should connect. If not, maybe PhpStorm is not listening, or not configured to listen on port 9000?
- Check to make sure that Xdebug is enabled. You can use `php -i | grep -i xdebug` inside the container, or use any other technique you want that gives the output of `phpinfo()`, including Drupal’s `admin/reports/status/php`. You should see with `Xdebug v3` and `php -i | grep xdebug.mode` should give you `xdebug.mode => debug,develop => debug,develop`.
- Set a breakpoint in the first relevant line of your index.php and then visit the site in a browser. It should stop at that first line.
- If you’re using a flavor of IDE that connects directly into the web container like VS Code Language Server, you may want to use the global `xdebug_ide_location` setting to explain to DDEV the situation. For example, `ddev config global --xdebug-ide-location=container`, which tells the PHP/Xdebug to connect directly to the listener inside the container.
- To find out what DDEV is using for the value of `host.docker.internal` you can run `DDEV_DEBUG=true ddev start` and it will explain how it’s getting that value, which help troubleshoot some problems. You’ll see something like `host.docker.internal=192.168.5.2` when running on Colima which can explain the usage.

For more, [check out Troubleshooting Xdebug on DDEV docs](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/debugging-profiling/step-debugging/#troubleshooting-xdebug)


## What is listening on port 9000?

To check if something is listening on port 9000 (the default port for xdebug) it's best to use `lsof` although there are a few other options:

```sh
lsof -i TCP:9000
```

Here is the output from `lsof -i TCP:9000` where it reports that PhpStorm is listening:

```sh
COMMAND    PID   USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
phpstorm 24380 selwyn  525u  IPv6 0xb7fc31a42f1fb36d      0t0  TCP *:cslistener (LISTEN)
```

Here `lsof -i TCP:9000` reports that `php-fpm` is listening.

```sh
COMMAND PID USER FD TYPE DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME

php-fpm 732 selwyn 7u IPv4 0x4120ed57a07e871f 0t0 TCP
localhost:cslistener (LISTEN)

php-fpm 764 selwyn 8u IPv4 0x4120ed57a07e871f 0t0 TCP
localhost:cslistener (LISTEN)

php-fpm 765 selwyn 8u IPv4 0x4120ed57a07e871f 0t0 TCP
localhost:cslistener (LISTEN)
```




You can also try `netstat` or `nc` both of which are slightly less informative:

Here is the output from `netstat -an | grep 9000` indicating something is listening on port 9000:
```sh
tcp46      0      0  *.9000                 *.*                    LISTEN
```

And from the `nc -z localhost 9000` command showing something is listening on port 9000: 
```sh
Connection to localhost port 9000 [tcp/cslistener] succeeded!
```









## Create your settings.local.php


1\. Copy, rename, and move the sites/example.settings.local.php to sites/default/settings.local.php:

`$ cp sites/example.settings.local.php sites/default/settings.local.php`

2\. Open sites/default/settings.php and uncomment these lines:

```php
if (file_exists($app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php')) {
  include $app_root . '/' . $site_path . '/settings.local.php';
}
```
This will include the local settings file as part of Drupal\'s settings
file.

3\. Open settings.local.php and make sure development.services.yml is
enabled.

```php
$settings['container_yamls'][] = DRUPAL_ROOT . '/sites/development.services.yml';
```

By default development.services.yml contains the settings to disable Drupal caching:

```yaml
services:
  cache.backend.null:
    class: Drupal\Core\Cache\NullBackendFactory
```
::: tip
 Do not create development.services.yml, it exists under /sites
:::

4\. In `settings.local.php` change the following to be TRUE if you want to
work with enabled css- and js-aggregation:

```php
$config['system.performance']['css']['preprocess'] = FALSE;
$config['system.performance']['js']['preprocess'] = FALSE;
```

5\. Uncomment these lines in settings.local.php to disable the render
cache and disable dynamic page cache:

```php
$settings['cache']['bins']['render'] = 'cache.backend.null';
$settings['cache']['bins']['dynamic_page_cache'] = 'cache.backend.null';
```

Add the following lines to your sites/default/settings.local.php

```php
$settings['cache']['bins']['page'] = 'cache.backend.null';
```

If you do not want to install test modules and themes, set the following
to FALSE:

```php
$settings['extension_discovery_scan_tests'] = FALSE;
```

6\. Open sites/development.services.yml in the sites folder and add the
following block to disable the twig cache and enable twig debugging:

```twig
parameters:
  twig.config:
    debug: true
    auto_reload: true
    cache: false
```
If the parameters section is already present in the development.services.yml file, append the twig.config section to it.

::: tip Note
The new way to enable Twig debugging is via the user interface. In the menus select `Configuration`, `Development`, `Development Settings` (or navigate to `/admin/config/development/settings`) and check the `Twig development mode` box, then check the boxes for  `Twig debug mode` and `disable Twig cache`.  You can also check the `Do not cache markup` at this time.

:::

7\. Rebuild the Drupal cache (`ddev drush cr`) otherwise your website will encounter an unexpected error on page reload.

Refer to this article: [Disable Drupal (>=8.0) caching during development on drupal.org - updated May 2023](https://www.drupal.org/node/2598914)

## Development.services.yml

Recommended setup for development is to have this file in `sites/default/development.services.yml`.

```yml
# Local development services.
#
# To activate this feature, follow the instructions at the top of the
# 'example.settings.local.php' file, which sits next to this file.
parameters:
  http.response.debug_cacheability_headers: true
  twig.config:
    # Twig debugging:
    #
    # When debugging is enabled:
    # - The markup of each Twig template is surrounded by HTML comments that
    #   contain theming information, such as template file name suggestions.
    # - Note that this debugging markup will cause automated tests that directly
    #   check rendered HTML to fail. When running automated tests, 'debug'
    #   should be set to FALSE.
    # - The dump() function can be used in Twig templates to output information
    #   about template variables.
    # - Twig templates are automatically recompiled whenever the source code
    #   changes (see auto_reload below).
    #
    # For more information about debugging Twig templates, see
    # https://www.drupal.org/node/1906392.
    #
    # Not recommended in production environments
    # @default false
    debug: true
    # Twig auto-reload:
    #
    # Automatically recompile Twig templates whenever the source code changes.
    # If you don't provide a value for auto_reload, it will be determined
    # based on the value of debug.
    #
    # Not recommended in production environments
    # @default null
    #    auto_reload: null
    auto_reload: true
    # Twig cache:
    #
    # By default, Twig templates will be compiled and stored in the filesystem
    # to increase performance. Disabling the Twig cache will recompile the
    # templates from source each time they are used. In most cases the
    # auto_reload setting above should be enabled rather than disabling the
    # Twig cache.
    #
    # Not recommended in production environments
    # @default true
    cache: false
services:
  cache.backend.null:
    class: Drupal\Core\Cache\NullBackendFactory
```

Make sure the following is in `docroot/sites/default/settings.local.php`.

```php
/**
 * Enable local development services.
 */
$settings['container_yamls'][] = DRUPAL_ROOT . '/sites/development.services.yml';
```

## Enable twig debugging output in source

:::tip Note
The new way to enable Twig debugging is via the user interface. In the menus select `Configuration`, `Development`, `Development Settings` (or navigate to `/admin/config/development/settings`) and check the `Twig development mode` box, then check the boxes for  `Twig debug mode` and `disable Twig cache`.  You can also check the `Do not cache markup` at this time.
:::

In `sites/default/development.services.yml` set `twig.config debug:true`.
See `core.services.yml` for lots of other items to change for development

```yml
# Local development services.
#
parameters:
  http.response.debug_cacheability_headers: true
  twig.config:
    debug: true
    auto_reload: true
    cache: false

# To disable caching, you need this and a few other items
services:
  cache.backend.null:
    class: Drupal\Core\Cache\NullBackendFactory
```

to enable put the following in settings.local.php:

```php
/**
 * Enable local development services.
 */
$settings['container_yamls'][] = DRUPAL_ROOT . '/sites/development.services.yml';
```

You also need to disable the render cache in settings.local.php with:

```php
$settings['cache']['bins']['render'] = 'cache.backend.null';
```

## Kint
[Kint](https://kint-php.github.io/kint/) for PHP is a tool designed to present your debugging data in the absolutely best way possible. In other words, it’s var_dump() and debug_backtrace() on steroids. Easy to use, but powerful and customizable. An essential addition to your development toolbox.

Here is a [detailed tutorial on how to print variables using Devel and Kint in Drupal - February 2022](https://www.webwash.net/how-to-print-variables-using-devel-and-kint-in-drupal/).

### Setup

We need both the the [Devel](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) and the [Devel Kint Extras](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel_kint_extras) modules.  Devel Kint Extras ships with the `kint-php` library which will be automatically installed if you install Devel Kint Extras using Composer:

```sh
$ composer require drupal/devel drupal/devel_kint_extras
```

Enable both with the following Drush command:

```sh
$ drush en devel_kint_extras -y
```

Finally, enable Kint Extended as the Variables Dumper. To do this go to `admin/config/development/devel` and select `Kint Extender` and Save the configuration.

::: tip Note
These plugins can cause out-of-memory errors. So, to make sure you don't run into these when using this module, make sure to add the following snippet to your `settings.local.php`:

```php
if (class_exists('Kint')) {
  // Change the maximum depth to prevent out-of-memory errors for Kint ver 5.
  \Kint::$max_depth = 4;
}
```

In Kint 4 this setting was renamed, so if you're using that version use the following snippet:

```php
if (class_exists('Kint')) {
  // Change the maximum depth to prevent out-of-memory errors for Kint ver 4.
  \Kint::$depth_limit= 4;
}
```
:::

### Add kint to a custom module

```php
function custom_kint_preprocess_page(&$variables) { 
  kint($variables['page']);
 }
```

### Dump variables in a TWIG template

```twig
{{ kint(attributes) }}
```

### Kint::dump

From [Migrate Devel contrib module](https://www.drupal.org/project/migrate_devel), in `/docroot/modules/contrib/migrate_devel/src/EventSubscriber/MigrationEventSubscriber.php`.

This is used in migrate to dump the source and destination values.

```php
// We use kint directly here since we want to support variable naming.
kint_require();
\Kint::dump($Source, $Destination, $DestinationIDValues);
```

### Set max levels to avoid running out of memory
This keeps your system from slowing down and running out of memory when using Kint.

Add this to `settings.local.php`

```php
// Change kint maxLevels setting:
//include_once(DRUPAL_ROOT . '/modules/contrib/devel/kint/kint/Kint.class.php');
if (class_exists('Kint')) {
  // Change the maximum depth to prevent out-of-memory errors for Kint ver 5.
  \Kint::$max_depth = 4;
}
```

## Replacing deprecated functions
If you need to find a deprecated function, you can search for it (in the `keywords` field) at the [Change Records on drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/list-changes/drupal) to find out how to replace it with a current function. For example, when searching for `taxonomy_get_tree` the site suggests:

```php
 // Procedural code - for OO code, inject the TermStorage object.
  $tree = \Drupal::entityTypeManager()->getStorage('taxonomy_term')->loadTree($vid, $parent, $max_depth, $load_entities);
```
It also suggests: 
> TermStorageInterface::loadTree() now returns an array of all term objects in the tree. Each term object is extended to have "depth" and "parents" attributes in addition to its normal ones (aka the original return of taxonomy_get_tree()).

More [on stackexchange](https://drupal.stackexchange.com/questions/144147/get-taxonomy-terms)


## Missing module

If you see a PHP warning such as `The following module is missing from the file system...` (or similar) on your site, Here are some ways to remove it:

A quick solution is to run `drush cedit core.extension` - you can then delete the line containing the unwanted module.  

::: tip Note
Run `drush cr` first to try to get things sane.
This opens the config in vim so you can use `/tracer` to search for tracer, `dd` to delete a line, `:wq` to save
Also if this fails, just try it again.  Sometimes, it fails with a message like:
```
  The command "${VISUAL-${EDITOR-vi}} /tmp/drush_tmp_1711122194_65fda712e42d6/core.extension.yml" failed.
  Exit Code: 1(General error)
  Working directory: /Users/selwyn/Sites/ddev101/web

  Output:
  ================
  Error Output:
  ================
```
:::

Also check out [Manually removing a missing module](https://www.drupal.org/docs/updating-drupal/troubleshooting-database-updates#s-manually-removing-a-missing-module)


If this doesn't work for you, try the following query:

```
$ drush sql-query "DELETE FROM key_value WHERE name='module_name';"
```
More at [How to fix "The following module is missing from the file system..." warning messages on Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/node/2487215) 






## You have requested a non-existent service

```
Symfony\Component\DependencyInjection\Exception\ServiceNotFoundException: You have requested a non-existent service "lingotek.content_translation". in /var/www/vendor/symfony/dependency-injection/ContainerBuilder.php on line 1063 #0 
```

Sometimes, when drush cr throws errors like that try `drush sqlc` and then `truncate cache_bootstrap` and `truncate cache_discovery`.


## Generating Test Content with Devel Generate

When building a Drupal website, it is useful to populate the site with enough content to check the overall displays when using layouts, views and design. It becomes important to test the website out with dummy content before adding live content. Instead of manually typing or importing data, the [Devel module](https://www.drupal.org/project/devel) allows you to create dummy content automatically.  

More at:
- [Working with the devel module in Drupal 9 to generate dummy content by Karishma Amin - August 2023](https://www.specbee.com/blogs/devel-module-in-drupal-9-to-generate-dummy-content)
- [Generating dummy Drupal content with Devel & more - October 2021](https://gole.ms/guidance/generating-dummy-drupal-content-devel-more)

## Enable verbose display of warning and error messages

In `settings.local.php` (or`settings.php` or `settings.ddev.php`) set the following config:

```php
// Enable verbose logging for errors.
// https://www.drupal.org/forum/support/post-installation/2018-07-18/enable-drupal-8-backend-errorlogdebugging-mode
$config['system.logging']['error_level'] = 'verbose';
```
